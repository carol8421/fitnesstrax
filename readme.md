# Fitnesstrax

Privacy-first fitness tracking. Your health, your data, your machine.

This application is deeply inspired by the work that I did on [an older health application](https://github.com/savannidgerinel/health). It will eventually be a full replacement for that application, but with improved architecture from several years of learning.


## User Interface

I need to decide on a user interface style.

At this point, most developers would build out a web service and write a react/redux app and be done with that. But, this is basically a single user application, so it would make equal sense to create a GUI app. Fewer security flaws until I add communication. But potentially a lot more work. But also, potentially, an opportunity for jobs currently not open to me.

But, really, a native app is easier on users if I'm expecting them to host the app themselves.
